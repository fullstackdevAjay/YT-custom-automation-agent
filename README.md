# YT Custom Automation Agent

**The open-source AI agent that runs a YouTube channel end to end — including automatic Shorts.**

Research topics → write scripts → generate narration and visuals → assemble videos → optimize metadata → review → schedule → publish → learn from analytics. Each long-form video can also spin off several vertical YouTube Shorts from its own script, through the same review gate.

- **Self-hosted:** your credentials, media, and channel data stay under your control.
- **Approval-first:** nothing is scheduled until quality, rights, and human-review gates pass by default.
- **Provider-flexible:** use Gemini, OpenAI, OpenRouter, Kimi, MiMo, GLM, or another OpenAI-compatible endpoint.
- **Observable:** follow persistent generation jobs, failures, review state, publishing, and local activation milestones from the dashboard.
- **Long-form + Shorts:** every real long-form video can automatically produce several vertical Shorts from its own already-written script.

<!-- Launch gate: add only a real 30–45 second dashboard demo captured from a verified end-to-end run. -->

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fullstackdevAjay/yt-custom-automation-agent.git
cd yt-custom-automation-agent
npm install
npm run walkthrough
npm start
```

Open `http://localhost:3456`. The walkthrough explains each provider choice, tests credentials, and guides YouTube authorization.

Already know what you are doing? `npm run setup` offers a shorter classic flow, and `.env.example` documents every setting.

### What you need

- Node.js 18+
- A Google account and YouTube Data API credentials
- At least one AI text provider key
- FFmpeg, installed automatically through `ffmpeg-static`

Gemini offers free access for supported text and TTS usage. Gemini AI image generation currently requires paid-tier access; without an image provider, Lumen can assemble gradient-based visuals instead.

## From idea to published video

| Stage | What Lumen does | What you control |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Research | Finds topics and builds a content strategy | Niche, audience, blocked topics |
| Script | Writes the hook, narrative, CTA, and metadata | Voice, format, length, brand direction |
| Production | Generates narration and visuals, then assembles a real MP4 | Provider choice and media fallbacks |
| Shorts | Derives vertical Shorts from the same script once the long video is real | How many, max length, publish spacing |
| Review | Runs quality checks and opens the video in Review Studio | Facts, media rights, edits, approval |
| Publish | Schedules and uploads approved content | Privacy, timing, final decision |
| Learn | Pulls performance signals into the next strategy cycle | Automation and optimization settings |

Lumen distinguishes real MP4 output from simulated placeholders. Simulated output cannot enter the approval or publishing path — this applies to Shorts too, so nothing gets scheduled from a long video that only produced placeholder assets.

For release history, see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

```

## How It Works

Each agent handles one stage of the pipeline:

| Agent | Role |
|-------|------|
| **Content Strategy** | Analyzes YouTube trends, identifies topics, plans content calendar |
| **Script Writer** | Generates scripts with hooks, storytelling, CTAs |
| **Thumbnail Designer** | Creates thumbnails, runs A/B variations |
| **SEO Optimizer** | Keywords, titles, descriptions, tags |
| **Production** | Coordinates TTS audio, image assets, video assembly |
| **Shorts Generator** | Picks eligible script sections and renders vertical Shorts from a real long video |
| **Publishing** | Uploads, schedules, manages playlists (long videos and Shorts alike) |
| **Analytics** | Tracks performance, feeds insights back to strategy |

## AI Providers

All OpenAI-compatible providers work out of the box — the system auto-configures the SDK base URL. Pick one, or use OpenRouter to access everything through a single key.

    subgraph Router
        OR[OpenRouter<br/>400+ models]
    end
    Direct --> YAA[YouTube Automation Agent]

```

| Provider | Models | Base URL | Cost |
|----------|--------|----------|------|
| **OpenAI** | GPT-5.6 Sol, Terra, Luna | `api.openai.com/v1` | provider pricing |
| **OpenRouter** | 400+ models; curated defaults are validated against its live catalog | `openrouter.ai/api/v1` | varies by model |
| **Google Gemini** | Gemini 3.7 Flash, 3.1 Pro Preview, 3.5 Flash-Lite | via `@google/genai` SDK | free tiers vary by model and modality |
| **Kimi (Moonshot AI)** | Kimi K3, K2.7 Code, K2.6 | `api.moonshot.ai/v1` | provider pricing |
| **MiMo (Xiaomi)** | MiMo V2.5 Pro, V2.5 | `api.xiaomimimo.com/v1` | provider pricing |
| **GLM (Zhipu AI)** | GLM-5.3, 5.2, 5.1 | `api.z.ai/api/paas/v4/` | provider pricing |

Additional integrations: Anthropic Claude (`claude-fable-5`), ElevenLabs (Eleven v3 TTS), Replicate (Wan 2.7 video), local models via Ollama, any OpenAI-compatible endpoint.

## Configuration

### API Keys

#### YouTube Data API (required, free)

1. Create a project in [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Enable **YouTube Data API v3**
3. Create an OAuth 2.0 client (Desktop app)
4. Save the JSON as `config/credentials.json`

#### OpenAI

1. Get a key from [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/)
2. Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in `.env`

#### OpenRouter (easiest — one key, all models)

1. Get a key from [openrouter.ai/keys](https://openrouter.ai/keys)
2. Set `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` in `.env`

#### Google Gemini

1. Get a key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/)
2. Set `GEMINI_API_KEY` in `.env`

#### Kimi / MiMo / GLM

| Provider | Get key at | Env var |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Kimi (Moonshot AI) | [platform.kimi.ai](https://platform.kimi.ai) | `MOONSHOT_API_KEY` |
| MiMo (Xiaomi) | [mimo.mi.com](https://mimo.mi.com) | `MIMO_API_KEY` |
| GLM (Zhipu AI) | [z.ai](https://z.ai) | `GLM_API_KEY` |

### Environment Variables

# Optional: protect mutating API routes (POST /generate, /publish)
# API_KEY=some-long-random-string

# Optional anonymous activation milestones (off by default; HTTPS endpoint required)
# ANONYMOUS_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=false
# ANONYMOUS_TELEMETRY_ENDPOINT=https://your-collector.example/events
```

### Activation measurement and privacy

The dashboard calculates setup, first-real-MP4, approval, publication, and repeat-generation milestones locally from SQLite and files on disk. A video counts only when a non-simulated `.mp4` with an MP4 container signature still exists.

Anonymous milestone reporting is disabled by default and has no built-in collector. It activates only when you explicitly set both telemetry variables. The allowlisted payload contains the milestone name and time, Lumen version, OS family, Node major version, and a random installation ID. It never includes credentials, channel data, prompts, topics, titles, filenames, or video contents.

## Automation Schedule

```mermaid
gantt
    title Daily Pipeline
    dateFormat HH:mm
    axisFormat %H:%M

    section Content
    Generate content (strategy + script + thumbnail + SEO) :06:00, 2h

    section Publishing
    Process publishing queue :crit, 08:00, 14h

    section Analytics
    Collect analytics     :09:00, 1h
    Run optimizations     :22:00, 1h
```

The scheduler runs automatically after `npm start`. Content generation at 06:00, publishing queue processed every 15 minutes, analytics at 09:00, optimization at 22:00. Weekly strategy reviews run on Sundays.

## API

```bash
# health check
curl http://localhost:3456/health

# queue a video-generation job (send x-api-key if API_KEY is set in .env)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3456/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: $API_KEY" \
  -d '{"topic": "Top 10 Life Hacks", "style": "list"}'

# inspect the returned background job
curl http://localhost:3456/api/jobs/:jobId

# view schedule
curl http://localhost:3456/schedule

# get analytics
curl http://localhost:3456/analytics

# inspect, edit, and approve content before scheduling
curl http://localhost:3456/api/content/:contentId
curl -X POST http://localhost:3456/api/content/:contentId/approve \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: $API_KEY" \
  -d '{"privacyStatus":"private","factChecked":true,"rightsConfirmed":true}'
```

## Production Pipeline

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph TTS["Audio Generation"]
        direction TB
        EL[ElevenLabs v3] -.->|fallback| OA[OpenAI TTS]
        OA -.->|fallback| SIM1[Simulation]
    end

    subgraph IMG["Image Generation"]
        direction TB
        GPT[GPT Image 2] -.->|fallback| SIM2[Simulation]
    end

    subgraph VID["Video Assembly"]
        direction TB
        WAN[Wan 2.7 I2V] -.->|fallback| PW[Playwright Slideshow]
        PW -.->|fallback| SIM3[Simulation]
    end

    TTS --> MIX[FFmpeg Mux]
    IMG --> VID
    VID --> MIX
    MIX --> OUT[Final Video]
```

Each stage has graceful fallbacks. If a paid API key isn't configured, the system simulates that step so the rest of the pipeline still runs.

## Shorts Generation

Once a long-form video finishes with a **real** (non-simulated) MP4, a separate follow-up job automatically builds several vertical Shorts from the same script — it never blocks or delays the next scheduled long-form generation, since it runs in its own job queue.

How a Short gets made:

1. Script sections are filtered to ones with enough narration text to stand alone and a short enough pacing estimate — generic filler sections are skipped, not padded.
2. The most substantial qualifying sections are picked, in their original script order.
3. Each one gets fresh narration (same TTS fallback chain as the long video) and a vertical (1080×1920) render, reusing the long video's already-generated visuals instead of paying for new images.
4. Every Short goes through the exact same quality-check → review → approve → schedule → publish path as the long video — nothing is exempt from the approval gate.
5. Publish times are staggered after the long video's own slot, so Shorts don't all land at once.

Configurable via `npm start`'s dashboard settings (or `PUT /api/settings`):

| Setting | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `shorts_generation_enabled` | `true` | Turn the whole feature on/off |
| `shorts_per_video` | `3` | Max Shorts generated per long video |
| `shorts_max_duration_seconds` | `90` | Only sections at or under this length are eligible |
| `shorts_publish_gap_hours` | `3` | Hours between the long video and each subsequent Short's publish time |

## Extending

### Custom AI provider

```javascript
// utils/ai-service.js
const Anthropic = require('@anthropic-ai/sdk');

class ClaudeAIService {
  constructor(apiKey) {
    this.client = new Anthropic({ apiKey });
  }
  async generateContent(prompt) {
    const message = await this.client.messages.create({
      model: 'claude-fable-5',
      max_tokens: 1024,
      messages: [{ role: 'user', content: prompt }]
    });
    return message.content[0].text;
  }
}
```

### Custom content types

```javascript
// agents/content-strategy-agent.js
const contentTypes = {
  'podcast': {
    duration: '10-15 minutes',
    style: 'conversational',
    thumbnail: 'podcast-style'
  },
};
```

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| `Missing credentials for: an AI provider` | Configure any one provider with `npm run credentials:setup` — OpenAI is not required |
| `'ffmpeg' is not recognized` / no .mp4 produced | Run `npm install` (fetches the bundled binary), or install FFmpeg and set `FFMPEG_PATH` |
| Video marked `simulated`, nothing uploads | Check the ✗ lines in the startup capability check — a key or FFmpeg is missing |
| "Processing publish queue" but nothing publishes | The queue log now shows what's waiting; content publishes at its scheduled time (default: next day 2 PM) |
| YouTube API quota exceeded | Check quotas in Google Cloud Console; reduce posting frequency |
| Content generation failed | Verify API keys and credits; check `logs/` |
| Publishing failed | Re-authenticate YouTube OAuth tokens; check video format |

Enable debug logging:

```bash
NODE_ENV=development DEBUG_MODE=true npm start
```

## Credits

This project is a fork of [Lumen](https://github.com/darkzOGx/youtube-automation-agent) by [@darkzOGx](https://github.com/darkzOGx), extended with:

- **Automatic Shorts generation** — every real long-form video can now spin off several vertical Shorts from its own script, through the same approval pipeline (see [Shorts Generation](#shorts-generation))
- **Reliability fixes** — corrected credential wiring so AI-generated visuals/narration actually pick up configured provider keys, and a thumbnail-fallback fix so a real gradient thumbnail is used instead of a broken placeholder when AI image generation fails

All credit for the original architecture, pipeline design, and provider integrations goes to the upstream project and its author.
